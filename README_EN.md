# Airline Reservation Manager

This repository hosts a Java application that creates and manages a lightweight registry of airline reservations. The main workflow generates CSV files, gathers passenger data through dialog windows (`JOptionPane`), and prints a formatted summary with helpful statistics.

## Key Features

- Reservation file creation with name, permission, and structure validation.
- Configurable field structure via enumerations (`Reservation.ReservationFields`).
- Assisted data capture using Swing dialog boxes (`JOptionPane`).
- Interactive prompt to decide how many reservations to capture per session.
- Console log formatted with headers, emojis, and optional filtered statistics.
- Summary statistics with optional filtering by reservation class (`Reservation.ReservationClass`).

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later.
- Operating system capable of running Java Swing interfaces.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository and enter the root folder:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Tarea-01
   ```
2. Move into the module that contains the source code:
   ```bash
   cd Tarea-01
   ```
3. Create the output directory and compile the Java sources:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p out
   javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
   ```
4. Ensure the JDK is installed and that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is configured.

## Running the project

From the `Tarea-01/` folder that hosts the source code (i.e., `Tarea-01/Tarea-01` relative to the repository):

```bash
java -cp out Reservation.Main
```

When launched, the program replays the three exercises packaged with the project:

1. (Optional) Create a base reservation file with three fields.
2. Build the master reservation file, capture passenger data via `JOptionPane`, and split the records by destination.
3. Validate an error-prone file to review how issues are reported.

Results are stored in `reservas_maestro.txt`, destination files are generated, and a formatted log is printed to the console. When `reservas_maestro_con_errores.txt` is present, the batch-validation flow is also showcased.

## Recommended workflow

- **Branches**: use feature (`feature/`), hotfix (`hotfix/`), and integration (`develop`, `main`) branches.
- **Commits**: keep action-oriented messages such as `Added: Support for destinations`.
- **Pull Requests**: document scope, local testing, and any noteworthy considerations.
